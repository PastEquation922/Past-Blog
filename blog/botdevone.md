### /quote commands
So, I just felt like making a joke commands lol. the slash command contains options 
for my quotes and some Sun Tzu and Technoblade potato war quotes.

### Modal command
So, recently in discord.js v13.7 introduced the new feature to call modals. it's basically a warning with extra form options. Super cool and provides many oppurtunities for developers. I might use this in the future to make forms like with Milrato bot.
